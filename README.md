# UpdatedDisneyDataProject
This is an updated version of the Disney Data Project where the stock prices of Disney from 2010 to 2020 are collected to determine trends and patterns. These trends and patterns are then, used to create predictions for the next five to ten years. While this project is similar to the other DisneyDataProject on this repository, I have decided to do a year by year comparison as well as look at the opening, high, low and and daily volume of stocks bought.
